## Introduction

The Attendance Monitoring System utilizes machine learning and deep learning algorithms to recognize and identify individuals based on their facial features. It captures live video streams or images and compares the faces with a pre-trained model to determine the identity of each individual. This system eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking and provides an efficient and reliable solution.

## Features

- Face detection and recognition: The system can detect faces in an image or video stream and match them with the pre-trained facial features.
- Real-time attendance tracking: The system provides real-time attendance tracking by continuously monitoring the video stream and updating the attendance records accordingly.
- Accuracy and reliability: By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, the system achieves high accuracy in face recognition, minimizing false positives and negatives.
- User-friendly interface: The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface to interact with the attendance monitoring system.
- Attendance reports: The system generates attendance reports based on the captured data, providing insights into attendance patterns and trends.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- Python: The core programming language used for the implementation.
- OpenCV: A computer vision library for image and video processing.
- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework for training and deploying deep learning models.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow.
- Dlib: A C++ library used for face detection and facial landmark estimation.
- SQLite: A lightweight database management system for storing attendance records.
- Git: A version control system for managing and tracking changes to the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-monitoring-system.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained facial recognition model and place it in the appropriate directory.

4. Set up the database for storing attendance records.

## Usage

1. Run the main application script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow the instructions on the screen to start the attendance monitoring system.

3. Customize the system settings and parameters as needed.

4. Access the attendance records and reports through the user interface or by querying the database directly.
